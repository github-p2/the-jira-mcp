# High-Level Design (HLD) - JIRA MCP Server

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level design for implementing a JIRA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. The project aims to create a comprehensive integration that enables seamless interaction with JIRA through the MCP protocol, with future extensibility in mind.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **MCP Server**: STDIO-based Model Context Protocol implementation
- **Google Agent SDK**: Future integration for 8-way protocol support
- **Pipeline Processing**:
  - YAML workflow configuration
  - Apache Hamilton for pipeline construction

### Architecture Philosophy
The system is designed with a step-by-step evolution approach, allowing for incremental development and feature additions while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation
- STDIO-based MCP server implementation
- Basic JIRA integration capabilities
- Core protocol handling

### Phase 2: Enhanced Processing
- YAML workflow configuration system
- Apache Hamilton pipeline integration
- Advanced data processing capabilities

### Phase 3: Future Extensibility
- Google Agent SDK integration
- 8-way protocol support
- Advanced agent capabilities

## Integration Flows

### Primary Workflows
1. **JIRA Data Retrieval**: Fetch issues, projects, and metadata
2. **Issue Management**: Create, update, and manage JIRA issues
3. **Project Operations**: Project-level operations and management
4. **Search and Filtering**: Advanced search capabilities across JIRA data

### Data Processing Pipeline
- Input validation and sanitization
- JIRA API interaction layer
- Data transformation and formatting
- Response optimization for MCP clients

## Product Evolution Vision

The system is designed to evolve from a basic MCP server to a comprehensive JIRA integration platform:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Core MCP functionality with basic JIRA operations
2. **Workflow Integration**: Advanced pipeline processing with YAML configurations
3. **Agent Capabilities**: Full agent SDK integration with multi-protocol support
4. **Extensible Platform**: Modular architecture supporting various integrations

## Development Approach

- **Iterative Development**: Step-by-step implementation with regular reviews
- **Technology Evaluation**: Continuous assessment of technology choices
- **Flexible Architecture**: Design decisions that support future modifications
- **Documentation-Driven**: Comprehensive documentation throughout development

## Notes

This document will continue to evolve as features are added and the system matures. Regular updates will reflect new requirements, technology decisions, and architectural changes.
