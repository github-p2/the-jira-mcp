## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Where to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

📧 **security@jira-mcp-server.dev**

If this email is not available, please use GitHub's security advisory feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/yourusername/jira-mcp-server/security) in our repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** - A detailed description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact** - The potential impact and attack scenario
3. **Reproduction** - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept** - Any code, screenshots, or logs demonstrating the issue
5. **Suggested Fix** - If you have ideas for how to fix the vulnerability
6. **Affected Versions** - Which versions of the software are affected
7. **Environment** - Operating system, Python version, etc.

### Response Timeline

We commit to the following response times:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on severity and complexity
- **Security Advisory**: Published after fix is released

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity classification:

#### 🔴 Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data breach potential
- Privilege escalation

#### 🟠 High
- Denial of service attacks
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection

#### 🟡 Medium
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Unauthorized data access
- Input validation issues

#### 🟢 Low
- Information leakage
- Minor security misconfigurations

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of JIRA MCP Server
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow our security configuration guidelines
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data like API tokens
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for all communications
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activities

### For Developers

1. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and check for vulnerabilities
2. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
3. **Static Analysis**: Use bandit and other security tools in your development workflow
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
6. **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data

## 🔍 Security Measures
